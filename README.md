# Celo Works Wallet

1. TrustWorks believes everyone should have access to financial services, no matter who they are or where they live. 

We enable this by transforming traditional financial services into transparent protocols that run on the blockchain, making them simple and affordable to access via any kind of mobile phone for users transacting less than $2 / day. 

1. TrustWorks is building the world’s first non-custodial wallet on KaiOS feature phones to enable up to 150 million low-income KaiOS users to send and receive Celo Dollars/Euros on phones that cost as little as 40 USD; thereby extending decentralised finance to millions who don’t have a smart phone but need it most. 


We are seeking funding to:

  - Further the development of the world's first non-custodial KaiOS wallet. 
  - Further test the wallet with KaiOS users in Latin America. 
  - Report documenting the learning / next steps to scale to 150m KaiOS users. 

We have multiple partners ready to start using the wallet to support micro solar payments in Tanzania to humanitarian cash-transfer programs across L.America. 

Thanks for helping us bring DeFi to those who need it most.
